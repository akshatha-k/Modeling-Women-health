### Modeling Women health care using Deep Learning

Given that the health landscape has rapidly changed over the last decade, it is increasingly important to understand the various factors that impact the healthcare decisions, cost and family planning decisions. Our study shall use data from the National Survey of Family Growth and Indian Goverment datasets on the questions that women face when considering various health care options as well as other data such as the awareness of family planning methods among women in India, women suffering from anaemia pre and post pregnancy. Our study will also revolve along determinants of health such as living and working condition, societal and economic policies etc. We aim to use SOTA algorithms to determine the primary factors that women consider while choosing healthcare along with the analysis and prediction of high risk areas in terms of poor family planning awareness and prevalence of disease.

The goal shall be to access reproductive women health care and the factors women consider when accessing health care services. Our system can also be augmented with an anthropometric study of women. The end product of our project will improve public health with novel predictive analysis using Deep Learning Methods.
